pip install -r requirements.txt

## Workflow Overview
- Data Collection & Cleaning â€” Handle missing values, outliers, and data types.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€” Visualize trends, distributions, and relationships.
- Feature Engineering â€” Create new features and encode categorical data.
- Model Building â€” Train and evaluate ML models.
- Model Tuning â€” Optimize hyperparameters.
- Visualization & Insights â€” Present results through dashboards or reports.
- Deployment â€” Deploy models as APIs or web apps.

## Results & Insights
Each project includes:
- Performance metrics (accuracy, RMSE, F1-score, etc.)
- Visualizations (heatmaps, plots, dashboards)
- Business or actionable insights
