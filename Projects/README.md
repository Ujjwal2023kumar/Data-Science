## WORKFLOW OVERVIEW
- Data Collection & Cleaning — Handle missing values, outliers, and data types.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Visualize trends, distributions, and relationships.
- Feature Engineering — Create new features and encode categorical data.
- Model Building — Train and evaluate ML models.
- Model Tuning — Optimize hyperparameters.
- Visualization & Insights — Present results through dashboards or reports.
- Deployment — Deploy models as APIs or web apps.

## RESULTS AND INSIGHTS
Each project includes:
- Performance metrics (accuracy, RMSE, F1-score, etc.)
- Visualizations (heatmaps, plots, dashboards)
- Business or actionable insights
