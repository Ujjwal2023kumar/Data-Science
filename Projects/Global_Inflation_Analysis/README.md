# POWER BI INFLATION ANALYSIS: JOURNEYING THROUGH GLOBAL ECONOMIC TERRAIN
- Inflation, a critical economic indicator, profoundly impacts businesses, consumers, and policymakers worldwide. In this scenario, a multinational corporation operating in diverse markets seeks to optimize pricing strategies, mitigate risks, and make informed investment decisions. Leveraging Power BI's analytical prowess, we delve into inflation data to offer tailored recommendations aligned with each market's unique economic conditions.

- Our approach involves data collection, preparation, and modeling to build a robust analysis framework. Through insightful visualizations and strategic recommendations, we aim to equip stakeholders with actionable insights for informed decision-making. Our deliverables include an interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing inflation trends and a comprehensive report summarizing analysis findings and recommendations.

### SCENARIO 1: LACK OF DATA INTEGRATION AND STANDARDIZATION
In the context of "Power BI Inflation Analysis: Journeying Through Global Economic Terrain," a key problem might be the lack of standardized data sources and integration methods. Different regions and organizations may report inflation data differently, leading to inconsistencies and challenges in aggregating and analyzing global inflation trends effectively within Power BI. This lack of standardization hampers the ability to provide accurate and comprehensive insights into inflation dynamics worldwide.

### SCENARIO 2: LIMITED HISTORICAL DATA ACCESSIBILITY
Another challenge could be the limited accessibility to historical inflation data across various countries and regions. This scarcity of historical data poses a significant obstacle in building robust predictive models within Power BI for forecasting inflation trends accurately. Without a comprehensive historical dataset, analysts may struggle to identify long-term patterns and correlations necessary for making informed decisions and projections.

### SCENARIO 3: COMPLEX ECONOMIC INTERDEPENDENCIES
The intricate interdependencies among global economies pose a complex challenge in "Power BI Inflation Analysis: Journeying Through Global Economic Terrain." Fluctuations in one country's inflation rate can have ripple effects across other regions, making it difficult to isolate and analyze the drivers of inflation within individual economies. Effectively capturing and analyzing these interdependencies within Power BI requires sophisticated modeling techniques and access to diverse datasets, which may not be readily available or easily integrated into the analysis platform.

Activity 1.1: Understand the data
Data contains all the meta information regarding the columns described in the CSV files.
Column Description of the Dataset:
1) Country_name: Name of the Country.
2) Inflation Rate: Inflation rate of each country.
3) Region: Region of country which belongs
4) Year:  represents the calendar year for which the corresponding inflation data is recorded.
5) AdjustedInflationRate: The 'Adjusted Inflation Rate' column is derived by multiplying the inflation rate by 0.01  .
6) InflationRateCategory:The 'Inflation Rate' column is categorized as           high, medium, or low based on predefined thresholds.

Data Preparation
Data preparation is a critical stage in the data analysis process, encompassing activities aimed at cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis. This process involves identifying and addressing issues such as missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in the dataset, ensuring data quality and reliability.


Prepare the Data for Visualization
Preparing the data for visualization involves cleaning the data to remove irrelevant or missing data, transforming the data into a format that can be easily visualized, exploring the data to identify patterns and trends, filtering the data to focus on specific subsets of data, preparing the data for visualization software, and ensuring the data is accurate and complete. This process helps to make the data easily understandable and ready for creating visualizations to gain insights into the performance and efficiency. Since the data is already cleaned, we can move to visualization.


Data Visualization
Data visualization is the process of creating graphical representations of data to help people understand and explore the information. The goal of data visualization is to make complex data sets more accessible, intuitive, and easier to interpret. By using visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps, data visualizations can help people quickly identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.
