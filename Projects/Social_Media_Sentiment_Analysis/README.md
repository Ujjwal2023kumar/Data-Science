- Analyze text data from social media to determine public sentiment
- Build machine learning and NLP models for sentiment classification
- Visualize sentiment trends and patterns through interactive dashboards
- Extract actionable insights to support brand monitoring and decision-making

## FEATURES
- Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization
- Sentiment Classification: Identify sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral)
- Interactive Dashboards: Filter by keyword, topic, or time period
