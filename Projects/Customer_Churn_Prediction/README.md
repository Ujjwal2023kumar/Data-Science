# CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using data analytics and machine learning. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave a service or subscription, enabling proactive retention strategies. The analysis transforms raw customer data into actionable insights through interactive Power BI dashboards and predictive modeling.

## OBJECTIVES
- Analyze customer behavior to identify churn patterns
- Build predictive models to estimate the likelihood of customer churn
- Develop dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboards for visualization
- Enable businesses to take data-driven actions to reduce churn

## FEATURES
- Interactive Filters: Filter by customer segment, region, and service type
- Dynamic Visuals: Donut charts, bar graphs, and line charts to compare churn vs. retained customers
- KPIs: Churn rate, customer retention rate, average customer lifetime value, and satisfaction score
- Trend Analysis: Time-series analysis of customer activity and churn behavior
- Comparative Insights: Identify high-risk customer groups and key churn drivers

## KEY INSIGHTS
- High churn rates often correlate with low engagement or poor customer support
- Retention improves significantly with loyalty programs and proactive communication
- Predictive modeling helps identify potential churners with high accuracy
- Visualization highlights the importance of personalized retention strategies

## TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
- Data Analytics: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Plotly), SQL, PowerBI, Excel
- Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM
- Platforms: Kaggle, Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
