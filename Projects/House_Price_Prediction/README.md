# HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION
This project focuses on predicting house prices using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze various housing features such as location, size, number of rooms, and amenities to estimate property values accurately. The Power BI dashboard and predictive models together transform raw real estate data into actionable insights for buyers, sellers, and investors.

## OBJECTIVES
- Analyze housing data to identify key factors influencing property prices
- Build accurate predictive models for estimating house prices
- Develop interactive dashboards for visualizing pricing trends and comparisons
- Demonstrate data-driven insights to assist in real estate decision-making

## FEATURES
- Interactive Filters: Filter by city, property type, and price range
- Dynamic Visuals: Bar graphs, scatter plots, and line charts to show pricing trends
- KPIs: Average price, price per square foot, demand index, and growth rate
- Trend Analysis: Study of housing price fluctuations over time
- Comparative Insights: Comparison of property prices across locations and features

## KEY INSIGHTS
- Location, property size, and number of rooms are major determinants of price
- Urban areas show higher price growth compared to suburban regions
- Feature engineering (e.g., distance to city center, amenities) improves prediction accuracy
- Visualization reveals market patterns useful for both investors and policymakers

## TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
- Data Analytics: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Plotly), SQL, PowerBI, Excel
- Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM
- Platforms: Kaggle, Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
