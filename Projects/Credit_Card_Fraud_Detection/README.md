# CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes transaction patterns to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent activities, providing actionable insights and real-time fraud detection capabilities.

## OBJECTIVES
- Identify and classify fraudulent credit card transactions
- Build a robust and accurate machine learning model for fraud detection
- Perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization
- Visualize transaction insights and fraud patterns through interactive dashboards

## FEATURES
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, class imbalance, and outlier detection
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features from transaction time, amount, and user behavior
- Machine Learning Models: Training and comparing multiple models for optimal accuracy
- Performance Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC for model evaluation
- Visualization Dashboard: Interactive Power BI reports showcasing fraud trends and model performance

## KEY INSIGHTS
- Fraudulent transactions often occur in specific time intervals and with abnormal amounts
- Class imbalance is a major challenge, requiring effective resampling techniques (SMOTE, ADASYN)
- Ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) outperform linear models in fraud detection
- Real-time monitoring and anomaly detection greatly reduce potential financial loss

## TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
- Data Analytics: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Plotly), SQL, PowerBI, Excel
- Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM
- Platforms: Kaggle, Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
