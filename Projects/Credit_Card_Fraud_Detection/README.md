# CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes transaction patterns to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent activities, providing actionable insights and real-time fraud detection capabilities.

## OBJECTIVES
- Identify and classify fraudulent credit card transactions
- Build a robust and accurate machine learning model for fraud detection
- Perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization
- Visualize transaction insights and fraud patterns through interactive dashboards

## FEATURES

- Interactive Filters: Filter by country, continent, and time period
- Dynamic Visuals: Donut charts, bar graphs, and line charts to compare key metrics
- KPIs: Total cases, total deaths, recovery rate, and vaccination percentage
- Trend Analysis: Time-series trends for daily and cumulative statistics
- Comparative Insights: Country-wise and continent-wise comparisons

## KEY INSIGHTS

- Peak global infection occurred in mid-2021, followed by recovery trends
- Countries with higher vaccination rates showed a significant drop in death rates
- Asia and Europe reported the largest share of global cases
- Visualization reveals the importance of timely vaccination rollouts

## TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
- Data Analytics: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Plotly), SQL, PowerBI, Excel
- Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM
- Platforms: Kaggle, Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
