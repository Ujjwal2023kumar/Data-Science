# CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes transaction patterns to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent activities, providing actionable insights and real-time fraud detection capabilities.

## OBJECTIVES
- Identify and classify fraudulent credit card transactions
- Build a robust and accurate machine learning model for fraud detection
- Perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization
- Visualize transaction insights and fraud patterns through interactive dashboards

## FEATURES
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, class imbalance, and outlier detection
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features from transaction time, amount, and user behavior
- Machine Learning Models: Training and comparing multiple models for optimal accuracy
- Performance Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC for model evaluation
- Visualization Dashboard: Interactive Power BI reports showcasing fraud trends and model performance

## KEY INSIGHTS

- Peak global infection occurred in mid-2021, followed by recovery trends
- Countries with higher vaccination rates showed a significant drop in death rates
- Asia and Europe reported the largest share of global cases
- Visualization reveals the importance of timely vaccination rollouts
